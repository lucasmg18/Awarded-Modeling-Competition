This consists of a dataset of photos of different types of fruits.
### New Datasets Generated
One of the main goals of this competition was to create a new dataset solely based on a very small set of data to be able to train a machine learning model and achieve a result similar to that obtained from the original dataset.  
The datasets generated with the different methods we have implemented are abailable in the following website: [Datasets Generated](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasmartingarcia/modeling-competition-generated-datasets/data)
